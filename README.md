# pa1010d-spin 
--------------

This is a P8X32A/Propeller, P2X8C4M64P/Propeller 2 driver object for the PA1010D GPS module

**IMPORTANT**: This software is meant to be used with the [spin-standard-library](https://github.com/avsa242/spin-standard-library) (P8X32A) or [p2-spin-standard-library](https://github.com/avsa242/p2-spin-standard-library) (P2X8C4M64P). Please install the applicable library first before attempting to use this code, otherwise you will be missing several files required to build the project.
